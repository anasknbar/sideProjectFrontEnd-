You're right that **hooks** can often handle logic for interacting with APIs or external services. Here's a clearer breakdown of when you'd use **hooks** versus **lib** for server-related logic:

### **Key Distinctions:**

- **`hooks/` folder**: Contains **React-specific logic**, including **custom hooks**. These hooks may interact with APIs, manage component state, or encapsulate other logic that relates directly to the behavior of components.
  
- **`lib/` folder**: Contains **general-purpose utilities or API clients** that are **not React-specific**. This is where you put functions that handle server interactions but are reusable in multiple contexts (e.g., fetching data, authentication, or database queries).

### **When to use `hooks/`:**

Custom hooks are designed to be reused **within React components** and provide a clean, encapsulated way to handle side effects (like fetching data from an API). You’d typically put server-related logic here if you need to tie it to React's lifecycle methods.

**Example in `hooks/useAuth.js`:**
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchUserData } from '../lib/api';  // This function could be defined in lib

export function useAuth(userId) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getUser = async () => {
      const data = await fetchUserData(userId);  // Using function from lib
      setUser(data);
    };
    getUser();
  }, [userId]);

  return user;
}
```

In this example:
- `useAuth` is a **custom hook** that **interacts with an API** to fetch user data. It leverages React's state (`useState`) and lifecycle (`useEffect`).
- The actual **API call logic** is imported from the `lib/` folder, keeping the API logic decoupled from the React hook.

---

### **When to use `lib/`:**

The `lib/` folder should contain **generic API clients** or helper functions that aren’t tied to the React lifecycle. These are reusable in any part of your app, including within hooks, context providers, or even server-side code (e.g., in API routes or SSR).

**Example in `lib/api.js`:**
```js
import axios from 'axios';

export async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

- `fetchUserData` is a **generic function** that handles API requests. It’s decoupled from React’s state or lifecycle, so you could reuse this in both client-side hooks and server-side code.
- This logic can be reused by hooks like `useAuth`, context providers, or anywhere else that requires user data.

---

### **Summary of When to Use Each:**

- **`hooks/`**: Contains **custom React hooks** that often **use API functions** from the `lib` folder. These hooks are tightly integrated with **React state** and **lifecycle methods**.
  - Example: `useAuth`, `useFetch`

- **`lib/`**: Contains **generic utilities** for API calls or logic that can be reused in multiple contexts (client-side and server-side). These functions aren’t tied to React.
  - Example: `fetchUserData`, `authClient`

### **Why Separate Them?**
- **Hooks** manage **React-specific** logic, which might involve API calls but also handles things like component state, side effects, and React’s lifecycle.
- **Lib** keeps the API logic **generic**, making it reusable outside React components (like in API routes, SSR, or other non-React contexts).

This separation keeps your codebase modular and easier to maintain. You can change your API logic in `lib` without affecting React-specific hooks.
